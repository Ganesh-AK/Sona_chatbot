  "responses": ["The Sona Group is steeped in more than 100 years of success and tradition tracing back to pre-Independence. The group was founded by the doyen of textile industries of the early twentieth century, Karumuttu Thiagarajar Chettiar. He oozed passion and patriotism for his motherland and fought for Her freedom along with other great freedom fighters of this nation. Karumuttu Thiagarajar Chettiar’s prominence is etched in the tapestry of our nation by the role he played in the transformation of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi to Gandhiji, The Father of our Nation. This defining moment played out in 1938, within the walls of Karumuttu Thiagarajar Chettiar’s home when Gandhiji visited Madurai. Gandhiji wore his trademark Loin cloth, vowing not to wear a shirt every again after seeing daily wage workers who could not afford one.\nKarumuttu Thiagarajar Chettiar saw the plight of workers in the plantations and fought for their liberation. His idea of liberation was to set people free and even to a higher level of setting minds free through education. He envisioned an Indian nation that would stand tall in the global stage built on its robust educated society with its traditional values and wealth. He set this idea in motion by establishing Thiagarajar Engineering College in Madurai, and Thiagarajar Polytechnic College, Salem, and sowed the seeds of quality technical education in India. Those seeds now stand as a global brand called ‘Sona’ whose roots run deep into education, textile, IT, research, manufacturing, outsourcing, logistics and many more. The Sona Group’s quest to cater quality higher education has led to its banyan tree like growth with Thiagarajar Polytechnic College, Sona College of Technology, Sona School of Management, Sona College of Arts and Science , Sona Valliappa Public School and Sona Medical College of Naturopathy and Yoga."],
